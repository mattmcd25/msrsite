## MSR Site

A web application built for Men on the Side of the Road in Namibia, to be used to manage their database of member information.

Designed using Node.js and Express for the back end, and React with the React-MD library for the front end. Intended to interface with an MSSQL database hosted elsewhere. 

This application was created by [mattmcd25](https://github.com/mattmcd25) and [wittenber0](https://github.com/wittenber0) as part of their Interdisciplinary Qualifying Project (IQP), a graduation requirement at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). The final version of the social science paper accompanying this application can be found [here](wpi.edu).
